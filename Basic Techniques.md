# How to find solutions to coding interview problems
	
	
	
	1. Visualize the problem by drawing it out
	2. Think about how you would solve the problem by hand
	3. Come up with more examples
	4. Break the question down into smaller independent parts
	5. Apply common data structures and algorithms at the problem 
	
	
# How to optimize your approach or solution 
	
 
	1. Identify the Best Theoretical Time (BTTC) Complexity of the solution
	2. Identify overlapping and repeated computation
 	3. Try different data structures
  	4. Identify redundant work - 
   		a. Don't check conditions unnecessarily
     	b. Mind the order of checks
       	c. Don't invoke methods unnecessarily
	 	d. Early termination
   		e. Minimize work inside loops
     	f. Be lazy
