# Intro
An abstract data type, supports the operations push (insert a new element on the top of the stack) and pop (remove and return the most recently added element, the element at the top of the stack). As an abstract data type.

Stacks can be implemented using arrays or singly linked lists.


This behaviour is commonly know as LIFO Last in is the first out.

 # VERY IMP FOR RECURVISE FUNCTION and used to implement DFS. DFS can also be iterative but mostly used in as recursive

# Implementations:

C++       std:: stack

Java      java.util.Stack

Python     Simulated using List

JavaScript   Simulated using Array

# Time complexity

Top / Peek    O(1)

Push          O(1)

Pop           O(1)

IsEmpty       O(1)

Search        O(n)


Corner cases:

  1. Empty stack. Popping from an empty stack
  2. Stack with one item
  3. Stack with two items
