    Model Type	Discriminative	Generative
Goal	The goal of a discriminative model is to directly estimate the probability of the output/target variable (y) given the input variable (x), written as P(y|x).	The goal of a generative model is to estimate the probability distribution of the input data (x) conditioned on the output/target variable (y), written as P(x|y). From this, it can then deduce the probability of the output given the input, P(y|x).
What's Learned	Discriminative models learn the decision boundary that separates different classes or output values.	Generative models learn the underlying probability distributions of the data.
In simple terms:

Discriminative models focus on learning how to directly predict the output given the input.
Generative models focus on learning the patterns and structure of the input data, and then use that to infer the output.
Discriminative models are more directly optimized for the task of prediction, while generative models try to build a more comprehensive model of the data. The choice between the two often depends on the specific problem and requirements of the application.
