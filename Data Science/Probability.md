Naive Def of Probability

  P(A)  = no of outcomes fav to A / no of outcomes

# Thinking Conditionally:

  Conditonal Independence:
    Conditional independence means that knowing one event does not provide any additional information about another event, given that a third event has occurred. 
            P(A∩B∣C)=P(A∣C)⋅P(B∣C)
    this implies:
              P(A∣B∩C)=P(A∣C)

  Independent events:

  Two events ( A ) and ( B ) are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. For independent events, the following holds true:
              P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)

  this implies,
                P(A∣B)=P(A)
              
    
  Conditional probability:
Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It's denoted as ( P(A|B) ), which reads as "the probability of event ( A ) given event ( B )"
              P(A∣B)= P(A∩B)  / P(B)
