# Intro

  DS implementing a structure that can map keys to value

# Collisions

  Seperate chaining - A Linked List is used for each value so that it stores all the collided items
  Open Addressing - All entry records are stored in bucket array itself. For new entry buckets checked, start with hashed to slot and proceed in some probe seq, until open slot found

 # Implementations:

C++ :  std::unorderd_map
Java: java.util.HashMap
Python: dict
Javascript: Object or Map

# Time Complexity

  Access - N/A - Accessing not possible as hash code is not known
  Search - O(1)
  Insert - O(1)
  Remove - O(1)
All above are avg cases

# Sample question of Hash Map

    1. Describe an implementation of a least-used cache, and big-O notation of it
    2. A question involving an API's integration with hash map where the buckets of hash map are made up of linked lists
