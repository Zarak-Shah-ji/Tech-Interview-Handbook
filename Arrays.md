# Arrays -  Mastery of array is essential for interviews!

Advantages:

        1. Store multiple elements of the same type with one single variable name
        2. Accessing elements is fast if we have the index as in linked list we need to traverse from head
        3. Constant time access to read and write

Disadvantages:

        1. Addition / Removal from middle is slow as all elements need to be shifted
        2. In C++ or other langs array size is fixed and need to create new array if array increases which takes O(n) time
